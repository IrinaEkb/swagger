 The Swagger team is proud to announce the M1 release of three of our main libraries and tools: swagger-js, swagger-ui and swagger-core. All release provide official initial support for Swagger 2.0’s main features. The missing features will be added in the next milestone releases until the final release is available.

In order to better improve these libraries and tools, we ask that you start using them and provide us with feedback in form of issues on the github repository. The issues are a huge help in finding what’s missing or not working properly (though note some issues are already submitted). We would also appreciate any PRs that improve existing or new tickets.

These releases could not have happened without the intensive support of the Swagger community. Each of the projects had a few PRs that really helped us push these projects forward!
